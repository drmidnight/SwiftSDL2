# SwiftSDL2

My attempt at wrapping SDL2. Heavily work-in-progress so don't use it. Hoping to have full coverage of SDL2 eventually.

*See [CSDL2](https://github.com/drmidnight/CSDL2) for bare C wrapper*
## Current progress:
*see [sdl.todo](https://github.com/drmidnight/SwiftSDL2/blob/master/sdl.todo) for overall progress. Contains a full list of the SDL2 API and progress.*
